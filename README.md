# SphereSweep
POV-Ray’s sphere_sweep primitive is a useful object, but it is prone to artifacts and unreliable automatic bounding. This module provides a variety of alternatives that approximate sphere sweeps using blobs or linear segments. Also included are sphere sweep approximations based on Bézier, natural, and quadratic splines; and an interface to the actual sphere_sweep primitive.

Macros for copying subarrays and controlling blob sizes are provided, as well as an interface to the Object Collection’s PointArrays module.

This project is a module from the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) Object Collection.
