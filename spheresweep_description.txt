POV-Ray's sphere_sweep primitive is a useful object, but it is prone to artifacts and unreliable automatic bounding. This module provides a variety of alternatives that approximate sphere sweeps using blobs or linear segments. Also included are sphere sweep approximations based on Bezier, natural, and quadratic splines; and an interface to the actual sphere_sweep primitive.

Macros for copying subarrays and controlling blob sizes are provided.

Version 2.0 added an interface to the PointArrays module and a more robust Bezier algorithm. Version 2.1/2.1A adds the quadratic Bezier spline.
